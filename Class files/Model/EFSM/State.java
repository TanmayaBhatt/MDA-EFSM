/*
    This class is the abstract State superclass in the De-centralized State Design Pattern

    Normally, each operation defined in this class should be abstract. However, due to Java-specific
    requirements regarding abstract classes, it was decided to instead default each operation to print
    a "not allowed" message.

    This is because if all methods in this class are declared abstract, then all abstract methods MUST be overridden
    by EACH state sub-class, and most state-subclasses would only ACTUALLY implement only 1 or 2 of the methods.
    The rest would have empty bodies and that is a waste of both coding space and memory space.

    In this design,
    methods are initially defined to print a "Not Allowed" message.
    Each state subclass inherits these methods and overrides the appropriate ones.
    This means that methods that do not get overridden will print a "Not Allowed" message
    if they are called from a state that does not allow them to be called
